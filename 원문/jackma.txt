I never in my life that had dreamed that today that I can wear this beautiful robe absolutely this kind of robe is not designed for for body size like a me so with great respect can I put my hat here and be myself sometimes to take honor heavier much more heavier than take the criticism life is like a box of chocolate you never know what you can get this is the movie that I love most the Forrest Gump's I fill three times in entrance examinations and I try too many times for enter good schools always fill my parents that I have a chance to get a bachelor degree my friends believe that a you and I will never be successful and but today I got adopted degree why you believe in yourself you have the chance when I started my business I told myself that if Jack Mott can be successful 80 percent of the young people in China can be successful nobody in my life said you are smart today many people say Jack how smart you are you can find the internet you build up the e-commerce I said it's not a me it's my team it's the dreams we believe together that reached that make us to today so what I want to tell you today on the way here and I say what I should share with you guys here because it's too early for me to share with you my live experience I'm still young and but I think one thing for sure that is very difficult to convince a successful people it's always easy to convince those people who want to be successful this is one of the reasons why this is one of the reasons why Alibaba survived that we try to convince young people to be more successful help them to be successful so some of the advices I want to give you here today is number one persistence always persistence to be yourself always persistent to your dreams and never ever say give up never ever say no I think all the parents try to tell us what is right what is wrong and my father always say he's better than I am my grandfather say he's better than my father but we proved we do better and I'm sure you will do much better than we do and one thing also for sure that always persist on the first a dream you had 14 years ago when I start my business in my apartment I told my wife in the future at that time by all the savings I have we have only five thousand US dollars so I asked my wife do you want the husband to be the richest person in China or you want to be your husband to be a respected business leader and she said be a business respected business leader this is what I want my husband to be so since then I know I don't want to be a rich person China I don't want to be a rich person in my city I don't want to be a rich person in my village I just want to be a person that can be respected and also one thing for sure if you want to be respected you have to stuff a lot and in Chinese I say neither the shumphlett super um once and that everybody has to suffer and the second thing I want to give a device to all the students here is always be optimistic and I always to be happy always to note tomorrow is better most of young people today complain that we don't have opportunities Jack Ma Ponemah all the people take all the opportunities we complain to in my time I'd complain Bill Gates you made about Microsoft that do not have any chance for me where other people complain that is your opportunity the world is always better human beings have survived after thousands of thousands and hundreds of disasters and yesterday is always the easiest today my philosophy in the Fastpass 214 years that one thing today is tough tomorrow is much more tougher but day of tomorrow is beautiful most people die to more evening you will never be able to see the sunshine of the day of tomorrow unless you work really hard and today also people complain that Hong Kong has no opportunities and I think Hong Kong has opportunity and I think today China has opportunity a lot of people would love to live lie on the yesterday success but I love to live in tomorrow's dreams yesterday Tong Hong Kong has a good family business real adds to the business and Lester day Hong Kong has European and UK working style today you have a new business style you have the new China so listen and try your best and the third which is very important to me and I believe it will be very important to all of you young people here embrace the change the world will never change unless you change yourself the world is changing so fast the value that in our company which is royal is which is very very unique is embrace the change we change every minute every time because when you change it is painful if you don't change it is very bitter you never know that life changes so fast so I believe one thing life is not about how much you achieved life is about how much you experienced a lot of books about us a lot of stories about us I'm sorry I did not read all of them because when I read the stories about me about us I feel shame we are not that good as people thought we're not that bad as people think we are just ourselves the book I want to write one day is Alibaba 1001 mistakes don't learn from the great success stories from the others learn from the mistakes the people make because most people make the same mistakes not all of them have the same success and life is about adventure young people just to go toilet go to China China is changing go to the world world is changing and always make sure that because of you the other people changed and the best way to avoid failure the best way to avoid failure in my life is to change when you are at the best to pick my companies experience that always destroy your good model good time when the time is the right which we say fix the roof when the sunshine is too there do not fix the roof when it rains so my best wish to all of you these are the three advice I give you the persistence that is optimistic and embrace the change and I wish all of you 20 30 years later with standing here where this beautiful rope and that will meet your size
